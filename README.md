# TelegramBotConventions
A collection of Conventions and best practices to standartise telegram bots

## Preface
:warning: This Repository is not affiliated with Telegram in any way. It is a collection written by developers for developers

The Goal of this Repository is to make handling new bots easier for both developers and users by defining a set of standard commands with determined behaviour so that all bots implement them.
